<h2>Cheesy-Crust Skillet Pizza</h2>

<p>This recipe turns the cheese on the pizza into the crust itself.
     So genius. Watch the video to see how easy it is to make with a non-stick pan.
      Top it any way you want, but use a light touch so the thin crust doesn't 
      fall apart.</p>

      <h3>ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 Â½ cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>5 cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons torn fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>4 small fresh mozzarella balls (bocconcini), thinly sliced</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly into hot skillet; cook until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.</li><p></p>
        <li>Arrange tomato slices, basil leaves, and fresh mozzarella slices on the melted cheese, leaving space for a "crust" to form; cook until top is bubbling and edges are browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li><p></p>
        <li>Remove skillet from heat and loosen pizza with a spatula. Gently slice pizza onto a cutting board; cool for 1 minute before slicing.

      </ol>
